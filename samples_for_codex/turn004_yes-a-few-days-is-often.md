Yes — a few days is often how long it takes for wax to naturally loosen and come out safely. Here’s what that means in practice:

🕐 Typical timeline

1. Day 1–2:
2. Day 3–4:
3. After 4 days:

🧼 Why it takes days

Earwax is sticky and compacted in some cases. Softening agents work gradually, allowing the wax to absorb moisture and break down without damaging the skin or eardrum. Fast or forceful removal attempts — especially with cotton swabs — risk pushing it deeper or causing injury.

🩺 If it’s still blocked after 4–5 days

At that point, it’s best to see a clinician. They can remove the wax safely using suction or special tools in just a few minutes.

Would you like me to outline a 2–4 day home care schedule with exact steps (drops, rinse, precautions)?
